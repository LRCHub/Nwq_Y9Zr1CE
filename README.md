[00:16.61] There's lilies
[00:21.15] That are flying
[00:25.68] In the sky while I dreamt of you
[00:33.73] I was sleeping
[00:37.86] Ever soundly
[00:42.15] By your side, oh, my sweet, sweet honeydew
[01:03.15] 
[00:50.79] When moons start to change
[00:54.72] The seasons fade
[00:58.96] I'll always be true
[01:01.17] And thinking of you, it makes my heart stand still
[01:07.25] Whenever I feel that I am so lonely
[01:11.86] I always know and always knew
[01:26.36] 
[01:18.00] There are 642 ways that I love you
[01:35.87] There are 642 ways that I want you
[01:52.23] When days are too tough
[01:55.10] And life gets too rough
[01:57.17] There's only one thing that I need
[02:01.35] It's when you are holding me close
[02:18.35] 
[02:09.02] There are 642 ways that I love you
[02:25.40] There are 642 ways that I need you
[02:42.25] When days are too tough
[02:44.91] And life gets too rough
[02:46.87] There's only one thing that I need
[02:50.81] It's when you are holding me close
[02:55.96] It's when you're holding me close
[03:00.98] To you
